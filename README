The master file is:
$ pdflatex beyond

There is another master file to generate selected parts of the book in
presentation mode:

$ pdflatex beyond.beamer


the parts are the ones inside the beamer enviorement

 \begin{frame}[fragile,allowframebreaks]
  ...
 \end{frame}

We have used the a trick with the coment package, in order that the
original master file ignores the frame enviroment. beyond.tex includes
the following lines:

 \usepackage{comment}
 ...
 \includecomment{frame}
 \specialcomment{frame}
 {\begingroup}{\endgroup}
 %\excludecomment{frame}

The figures/ dir contains the figures in pdf with some sources in svg.
